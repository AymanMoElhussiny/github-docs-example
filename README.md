## Notes for Git
I am tring to collect note for a wonderful course for git 
*McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Git*

### 06 remote
- You can have as many as remote repos that you want
- The default name is *origin*
  > it does not have any special thing  it is just a default name and also can be renamed
- you can add remote and check your remote as below
```bash
ayman@ubuntu-tst:~$ git remote add origin https://github.com/AymanMoElhussiny/hello-remote.git
ayman@ubuntu-tst:~$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/AymanMoElhussiny/hello-remote.git (fetch)
